  # The clock consists of two hands and a face (surrounding circle). The face is
  # used to store the rotation origin to use for the hands. All three cells share
  # the same 'clock' namespace. The hand stroke colors could be driven from bespoke
  # values, but in this example they are being sourced from the cell dataRef.
  # The constant 'handDRef' shows how to decouple the source data from the actual
  # formulas. There is only one clock in this example, but the formulas and drives
  # could be used by multiple clocks via yaml anchors with different data injected
  # via these constants.
